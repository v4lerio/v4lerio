### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Valerio, a name not very difficult to pronounce. My surname, instead, could be tricky for people in the English speaking world (I know, it is surprising for me too)!

Anyway, I am spending most of my working time on "trying" to breach systems as a penetration tester in the UK. 

For the remaining time, I keep myself busy with exploit development, reading, learning a new language, monitoring some areas in the deep and the dark sides of the internet, anonymously reporting security issues, and enjoying what many people call "sport" (whatever it may be for the day :running: :swimmer: :climbing:)

Sporadically, I write on an Italian Information Security online newspaper. I am also planning to publish more on a personal blog, I guess that's about time.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m open to new collaborations on security/osint/malware and volunteering in the real world!

Feel free to ask me anything about my personal or professional experience and I'll try to answer without breaching any confidentiality agreements :wink:
